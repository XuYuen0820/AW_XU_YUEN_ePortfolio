<h2>🪵Assignment 4 Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> 🧐What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>🐻I have learned about the Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, trees, deterministic finite automata (DFA) and finite state machine.</h4>

 <h3>👀 What can be improved? </h3>
<h4>🌰I hope to practice more exercises on deterministic finite automata and finite state machines, as I feel this assignment includes only a limited number of questions on these topics.</h4>

 <h3> 🤔Personal Opinion  </h3>
<h4>🍪I believe everyone should know about Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, as it is one of the simplest and most straightforward methods for finding the shortest path on a given map.</h4>
