🎩Assignment 3: [2024 1231 SECI 1013 Assignment 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDRqi-RugtSiiVRChI0qYGW8CQVfCNXr/view?usp=sharing)

<h2>🧵Assignment 3 Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> 🧐What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>🍇I have learned about the discrete probability theory, Bayes' Theorem, graph definition & notation, graph representation and isomorphism of graph.</h4>

 <h3>👀 What can be improved? </h3>
<h4>👗I hope to become more confident in expressing my ideas during discussions with my teammates.</h4>

 <h3> 🤔Personal Opinion  </h3>
<h4>🍒I love the probability theory, especially for Bayes' Theorem because I could find the probability of event A given event B P(A|B) when question given the probability of event B given event A P(B|A).</h4>
