<h2>🪄Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> 😎 What I Have Gained From That Day </h3>
<h4> 👣I have learned how to access the Microsoft Account provided from UTM for students, which will be a valuable resource for my studies. Additionally, I gained insights from the experiences shared by the brilliant staff at UTM Digital. They said that an environment is the essential element to decide someone's future.. I was also impressed by the advanced technology of  the digital smartboard there.</h4>

 <h3>👀What can be improved? </h3>
<h4>🧐 I hope that I could have more opportunities to attend industrial talks and visits in the future. These experiences could let me gain extra knowledge and practical insights, especially for Microsoft Office.</h4>

 <h3> Personal Opinion  </h3>
<h4>💪🏻The staff in UTM Digital are so nice and I have learned a lot about Microsoft Office on that day.</h4>
