<h2>🏮Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3 Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> 🧐What I Have Gained From These </h3>
<h4>🪸By doing these labs, I gained a better understanding of the components of IC circuits, such as AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates. I also learned how to construct a circuit for a synchronous counter using a clock and flip-flops.<h4>

 <h3>👀 What can be improved? </h3>
<h4>🧣 I could explore more circuits by watching educational videos on YouTube, which would help me gain a deeper understanding of their design and functionality.</h4>

 <h3> 🤔Personal Opinion  </h3>
<h4>🍷I find the labs interesting because I can discuss concepts with my partner and collaborate with her to construct the circuits, which makes the learning process more engaging and effective.<h4>
